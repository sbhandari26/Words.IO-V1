# Words.IO-V1
Words.IO is a Wordle clone created for my Game Development class. 
This project was created specifically for education purposes and will not be monetized in any way. 
Thanks to The New York Times for the idea and inspiration for the project! 
Thanks to Ania Kubów and her YouTube channel called "Code With Ania Kubów" for the tutorial (This is the tutorial I used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpby4HiElek).
